                    As a Computer Science graduate from Universidad Nueva
                    Esparta with over 3 years of working experience, I have a
                    strong foundation in technical skills and a passion for
                    using technology to solve problems. My experience includes
                    working as a Software Technical Support at Campify, where I
                    managed the complete use of the platform. Additionally, I
                    completed an internship as a Software Developer at SANNET,
                    where I participated in the development of a web application
                    to automate processes for a bank entity.
